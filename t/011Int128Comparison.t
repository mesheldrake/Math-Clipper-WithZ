# The following polygon with a -10000000000 offset
# triggers an overloaded comparison operator in 
# Clipper's Int128 class that is suseptible to 
# giving wrong results in the 2^63 to 2^64 range
# if it's args aren't cast to unsigned 64 bit ints.
# This test is to guard against regression in that
# section of code which might be suseptible to
# overzealous tidying, and to make sure we don't lose 
# this interim fix while waiting for the upstream 
# version that includes the author's fix.
